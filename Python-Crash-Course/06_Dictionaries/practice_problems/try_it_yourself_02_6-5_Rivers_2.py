# 6-5 Rivers: Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.
#  Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs through Egypt.
#  Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
#  Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

rivers = {'nile': 'egypt', 'ganga': 'India', 'amazon': 'brazil'}
