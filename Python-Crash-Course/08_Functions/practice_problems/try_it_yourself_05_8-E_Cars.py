# 8-14 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. The function should always recieve a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept any arbitiary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and the two other name value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
# Print the dictionary that's returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

def make_car(manufacturer, model_name, **kwargs):
    """Builds a dictionary with everything we know about a car."""
    kwargs['manufacturer'] = manufacturer
    kwargs['model Name'] = model_name
    return kwargs

car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
print(car)
